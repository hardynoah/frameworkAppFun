## Code Overview

For this project, I wanted to create a script that I could run whenever
I wanted to begin a new project that would allow me to quickly be
prepared, without the need to repeat the proecess of creating files and
folders.

![Parameter Code](../img/img1.png)

Firstly, we check if the user input a string parameter for the project
name when running the script. If not then we print out a reminder of how
to use the script and exit with an error.

Next, we use the two commands mkdir and touch -

```sh
  mkdir -p pathway/
  touch pathway/file.extension
```

to create the needed pathways and files for our project base.

Lastly, we use some printf and echo commands to write out to files. We
write out some basic html, css, and js just to make sure everything
works so that we don\'t need to check anything before beginning a new
project. As long as the website tells us that things our working, we are
good to start working on whatever project we want without any of the
basic setup needing to be done manually!

## What I learned

From writing this command-line script, I learn several new things.
Firstly, I got rid of the rust I had with using commands in the
terminal. I have used linux terminals in a few classes before, and had
prior experience with using it on Mac, but I had not written an sh
script prior to this assignment.

Additionally, I learned about Markdown and how to use it. I did not know
much if anything about Markdown prior to this assignment, and so I got
to learn how to write content for a website in a way that is much more
efficient than trying to use only HTML.
